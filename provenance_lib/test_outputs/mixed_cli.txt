# files are merged automatically by some interfaces, rendering distinctions
# between file inputs invisible in provenance. We output the recorded
# metadata to disk to enable visual inspection.
# The following command may have received additional metadata .tsv files. To
# confirm you have covered your metadata needs adequately, review the
# original metadata, saved at 'recorded_metadata/emperor_plot_0/'

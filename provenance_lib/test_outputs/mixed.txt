# Replay attempts to represent metadata inputs accurately, but metadata .tsv
files are merged automatically by some interfaces, rendering distinctions
between file inputs invisible in provenance. We output the recorded metadata
to disk to enable visual inspection.

# The following command may have received additional metadata .tsv files.
To confirm you have covered your metadata needs adequately, review the original
metadata, saved at 'recorded_metadata/emperor_plot_0/'

# NOTE: You may substitute already-loaded Metadata for the following,
# or cast a pandas.DataFrame to Metadata as needed.

# Instructions for use:
# 1. Open this script in a text editor or IDE. Support for Python
#    syntax highlighting is helpful.
# 2. Search or scan visually for '<' or '>' characters to find places where
#    user input (e.g. a filepath or column name) is required. If syntax
#    highlighting is enabled, input indicators will appear as syntax errors.
# 3. Search for 'TODO' comments in the script, and respond as directed.
# 4. Adjust the arguments to the commands below to suit your data and metadata.
#    If your data is not identical to that in the replayed analysis,
#    changes may be required. (e.g. sample ids or rarefaction depth)
# 5. Activate your replay conda environment, and confirm you have installed all
#    plugins used by the script.
# 6. Run this script with `python <path to this script>`
